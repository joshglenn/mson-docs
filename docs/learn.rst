Warning: This video is almost an hour long. It is not "polished" at all. But it could be helpful
to you if you're learning mson. You guys can learn from problems I encountered along the way and mistakes
I made.

Developers: What is the best way to learn MSON?
-----------------------------------------------

Here are some suggestions:

- Play with example apps in CodeSandbox
- Read everything Geoff Cox has written about MSON and its architecture
- Dive into the code with your debugger, especially the jest tests.
- If you aren't familiar with React and Material UI... learn them. They are used
  heavily in MSON-React
- Set up a development environment with MSON inside the src folder of your app,
  so that you can debug MSON es6 code instead of webpack-compiled es5 code

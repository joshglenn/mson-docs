What Is MSON?
#############

MSON is, at first glance, a framework for building web applications. However, it is actually closer to a full fledged 
programming language. It allows people with relatively little knowledge of programming to build an application
quickly. It can then be left as-is or extended for a wide range of purposes.

MSON was created by `Geoff Cox`_ to help people make great software with little effort.

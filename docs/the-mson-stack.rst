The MSON archicture currently consists of two main parts: 

  1. MSON The back-end "data" layer 

  2. MSON-REACT - the front-end user interface layer.

MSON is designed to work independently of a front-end UI layer. 
As mentioned by Geoff (the creator of MSON), it is planned 
that MSON will have other UI layers in the future. For now, MSON-React, 
which uses react and material-ui is the main UI layer.
